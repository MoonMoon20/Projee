        Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it
        everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every
        human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our
        joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and
        economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward,
        every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant,
        every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child,
        inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt
        politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and
        sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust
        suspended in a sunbeam. The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic
        arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and
        emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary
        masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited
        by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely
        distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their
        misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent
        their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the
        delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are
        challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in
        the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this
        vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us
        from ourselves. The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life.
        There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species
        could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the
        moment the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that
        astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is
        perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this
        distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our
        responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and
        cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.
